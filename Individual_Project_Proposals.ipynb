        "Understanding the relationship between demographic factors and academic performance is critical. By examining the relationship between age and gender and CSCS scores, we may discover hidden patterns or differences in performance. Such insights may allow educators to adapt teaching methods to more effectively meet the needs of specific student populations. Exploring demographic factors also supports equity practices. For example, if an age group consistently scores higher or lower than other groups, targeted supports may be needed for that group. Recognizing these demographic trends can contribute to building a learning environment that responds to varied student needs."
